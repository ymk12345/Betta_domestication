1. 2 sets of trios (2 Descendents/2Founders; 1 Descendent/2Founders)
2. Calculate Mendelian error; identify unlikely genotypes; remove any low PLs
3. Determine genotype errors shared by trios and remove across all samples
4. Calculate variant/invariants and normalize based on total variants accessible (can be called).
